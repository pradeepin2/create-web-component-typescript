# create-web-component-typescript

Note: This is very inefficient way, but a possibility for to understand how ts file is compiled
This is a sample example of creating a web component in typescript and hosting on github pages

All the development is done online in browser.

- Fork the repo.
- Use .(dot) command after forking the repo to launch Vs code and customise the code as per your requirement.
- Go to repository settings and create a github page as static site
- open your github page url to see your web component in typescript action.

credits to my experiment: 
1. MicroSoft for typescriptServices.js
2. bsarat for transpiler.js
3. polymer for providing shim allows elements written in, or compiled to, ES5 to work on native
